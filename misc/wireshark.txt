=====DAYTIME=====

1) Parts of the TCP 3-way handshake

1 192.168.64.2 132.163.97.1 TCP [SYN]
2 132.163.97.1 192.168.64.2 TCP [SYN, ACK]
3 192.168.64.2 132.163.97.1 TCP [ACK]

2) The client uses port number 56914.

3) The client needs a port to specify access for the server to the correct software/program on the client's machine during communication.

4) Frame containing the date and time

4 132.163.97.1 192.168.64.2 DAYTIME DAYTIME Response

5) The full content of the daytime response is:  \n60203 23-09-16 01:42:21 50 0 0 216.8 UTC(NIST) * \n

According to this document (https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1046.pdf), here is what each piece of the content represents:
60203 is the Modified Julian Day.
23-09-16 is the UTC date:  year, month, and day.
01:42:21 is the UTC time:  hours, minutes, and seconds.
50 indicates that the US is currently on Daylight Saving Time.
0 means that no leap second is imminent.
0 means that the time server is fully healthy.
216.8 is the time advance in milliseconds.
The * is for compatibility with the ACTS format.

6) [SYN] indicates that it is a "synchronize" packet.

7) [ACK] means that it is an "acknowledge" packet.

8) [FIN] means that it is a "finish" packet.

9) The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection. It sends the first [FIN] message which tells the nc client that it is done communicating (the source of this packet is the server's IP address, 132.163.97.1, which identifies who sent it).


=====HTTP=====

1) Two TCP connections were opened. There are two different client ports that undergo the TCP 3-way handshake with port 80 (HTTP):  58668 and 58684.

Here are the relevant frames for 58668:
1 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 TCP [SYN]
5 45.79.89.123 192.168.64.2 TCP [SYN, ACK]
6 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 TCP [ACK]

And for 58684:
2 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 TCP [SYN]
3 45.79.89.123 192.168.64.2 TCP [SYN, ACK]
4 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 TCP [ACK]

2) The homepage was requested in the following frame:

7 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 HTTP GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3) The photograph was requested in this frame:

11 192.168.64.2 45.79.89.123 HTTP GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1


=====QUESTIONS=====
How exact is the order of timing for the received packets? Are there ever delays in Wireshark that could cause the frames to display in a different order than they actually were sent (and would that matter)?

Is there any way to prevent Wireshark from picking up on packets (besides not using the virtual machine, applying filters, etc)?

What is the Ethernet II heading saying? For instance, if it says Src: 4e:27:a6:45:1c:d5 and Dst: 3e:06:30:13:14:64, what does that mean?
